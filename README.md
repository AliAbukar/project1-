In this project1, i built a book review website. 
Users will be able to register for my website and 
then log in using their username and password.When users log in,
they will be able to search for books,leave comments for individual books,
and see the reviews made by other people. 
I also used the a third-party API by Goodreads, another book review website, 
to pull in ratings from a broader audience.
Logout page:-Logged in users will be able to log out of the website.
Finally, users will be able to get the reselts for book details and 
book reviews via your websiteâ€™s API.
